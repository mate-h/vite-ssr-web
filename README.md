# vite-ssr-web

Example of a completely framework-less approach to building a web app. It's all about the developer tooling and the build process!

Current minimal dependencies:
- `vite` for development
- `vite-plugin-ssr` for SSR and SSG
- `typescript` for maintainability
- `express` and `ts-node` for serving the app
- `lodash` for utility functions
- `storeon` for state management
- `@phensley/cldr` for i18n
- `tailwindcss` and `postcss` for styling
- `schema-dts` for type definitions for Schema.org vocabulary

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the browser at http://localhost:3000/

For production:
```bash
npm run prod
```

## Artifacts

Some of the artifacts are available in the `src/gen` directory, which are generated by the scripts in `scripts/`. This is autogenerated typescript, and can include:
- CLDR data for specific languages and use cases
- Messages for i18n pulled from AirTable or other sources (like Transifex)
- Icon sets for use in the app, statically typed for convenient "dropdown" menus in VS Code

Here is an example base with i18n messages:

Run `npm run messages:pull` to pull messages from AirTable with your API key.
